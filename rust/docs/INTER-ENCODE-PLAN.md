# Inter-frame ENCODE — campaign plan, registered 2026-08-31 before any chunk lands

Owner directive (2026-08-31, verbatim): *"Zenav1-svt inter encode is better to
port than aom, right? Let's get that completed by midnight denver time, pay
attention to and fix things that make iteration slow; try wholesale porting of
thousands of lines and optimizing commandline runtimes."*

This file is the shared map for the campaign. It is a PLAN, not a status —
each chunk records its own result in its own doc/commit, and this file's
per-chunk lines are updated only with measured outcomes.

## 0. Where inter actually stands today (measured 2026-08-31, do not re-derive)

The port is still-picture only and **refuses inter frames at the public entry
point** (`pipeline.rs`, the `if !is_key` guard). That refusal is correct and
was measured: on 2026-08-03 a 5-frame 64x64 gradient encode produced a stream
`aomdec` called "Corrupt frame detected" and `dav1d` called "Overrun in OBU bit
buffer". The refusal names four header defects plus fresh-CDF MV coding, no
chroma in the DPB, and a homegrown (non-SVT) ME.

What is ALREADY ported and C-gated, and is therefore not the gap:

| piece | where | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| convolve horiz / vert / 2d / copy (the MC core) | `svtav1-dsp/src/inter_pred.rs` (768 lines) | `c_parity_inter_pred.rs` |
| warped motion | `svtav1-dsp` | `c_parity_warp.rs` |
| OBMC blending | `svtav1-dsp/src/obmc.rs` | `c_parity_obmc.rs` |
| MVP stack machinery (intra-frame branch) | `svtav1-encoder/src/intrabc_mvp.rs` (940 lines) — `scan_row_mbmi`, `scan_col_mbmi`, `add_ref_mv_candidate`, `sort_mvp_table`, `setup_ref_mv_list_intra` | IntraBC byte gates |
| SAD / variance / hadamard / satd kernels | `svtav1-dsp` | `c_parity_sad.rs`, `c_parity_variance.rs`, `c_parity_hadamard.rs` |

So the campaign is **encoder-side**, not kernel-side. The gap is: multi-frame
plumbing, the real SVT ME, the inter branch of the MVP stack, inter candidate
injection in MD, and inter syntax/MV entropy writing.

## 1. Why svt and not aom (the directive's question, answered with evidence)

For the ENCODER, svt is the better base:
- The differential oracle here reaches **real exported C symbols**
  (`svtav1-cref`, 185 bindings) — evidence tier 1 in `WORKING-ON-THIS.md` §4 —
  and it already exposes the inter-relevant ones: `svt_av1_encode_mv`,
  `svt_av1_get_mv_class`, `svt_aom_mv_err_cost`, `svt_av1_mv_bit_cost`,
  `svt_aom_estimate_mv_rate`, `svt_av1_find_best_ref_mvs_from_stack`,
  `svt_aom_mefn_ptr`.
- The MC/warp/OBMC DSP is already ported AND C-parity gated (table above).
- The byte-identity harness, op-trace differ and 1,057-test suite exist and are
  green, so a new inter cell inherits a working comparison rig.

The honest counterweight, recorded so nobody discovers it late: `zenav1-aom`
has a 2,499-line inter-ENCODE skeleton (`inter_me`/`inter_rd`/`inter_pack`/
`inter_costs`/`inter_frame`/`interp_rd`) and a byte-exact inter DECODER that
can validate an encoder in-repo. svt has neither of those, and SVT-AV1's inter
C surface is larger (~19.5k lines across `motion_estimation.c` 2964,
`mode_decision.c` 4419, `enc_inter_prediction.c` 3898, `inter_prediction.c`
2581, `adaptive_mv_pred.c` 2040, `av1me.c` 1159, `pcs.c` 1575, `md_process.c`
812) before TPL, temporal filtering and picture decision. "Complete inter
encode" is not a one-day scope on either base; what IS achievable is a chain of
byte-gated chunks, smallest-demoable-first, which is how every other envelope
in this repo was built.

## 2. Chunks

Ownership is per-file and strict — two chunks must never edit the same file.

| # | chunk | owns | gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| C0 | Multi-frame C oracle + inter identity harness | `tools/capture_c_trace/capture_c_trace.c`, `tools/identity_run`, new `tools/identity_diff_inter.sh` | a C reference 2-frame stream exists and the harness diffs frame 1 |
| C1 | Sequence/frame header parity for inter frames + CDF continuation (`primary_ref_frame`) | `entropy/obu.rs`, `pipeline.rs` header path | header bits byte-identical to C up to tile data |
| C2 | MVP stack, INTER branch | new `svtav1-encoder/src/inter_mvp.rs` + its tests | c_parity vs `svt_av1_find_best_ref_mvs_from_stack` + traced vectors |
| C3 | MV entropy coding + MV rate | new `svtav1-encoder/src/inter_mv_code.rs` + its tests | c_parity vs `svt_av1_encode_mv`, `svt_av1_get_mv_class`, `svt_av1_mv_bit_cost`, `svt_aom_estimate_mv_rate` |
| C4 | Wholesale ME port (`motion_estimation.c` + `av1me.c`) replacing the homegrown `motion_est.rs` | new `svtav1-encoder/src/inter_me.rs` + its tests | c_parity where symbols export; traced vectors where static, labelled tier 4 |
| C5 | Iteration speed | `docs/WORKING-ON-THIS.md`, test-harness config | measured before/after wall clock |

C1 depends on C0. C2/C3/C4/C5 are independent of both and of each other.

## 3. Standing rules for every chunk

- `WORKING-ON-THIS.md` governs. State your evidence tier (§4) in the commit
  message. A transcribed oracle agreeing with transcribed code proves nothing.
- Never relax a test, threshold or assertion; never add `#[ignore]`; never let
  a test silently skip when a fixture is missing.
- A cell earns a place in `regression_spotcheck.sh` only if it failed before
  the fix and passes after (§3).
- Report coverage as a fraction of the C surface, listing what is MISSING
  first. "Ported `motion_estimation.c`" means every function or a named subset,
  never "the important parts".
